# Juce Preset Manager
This is a Fork of [this project](https://github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/jucePresetManagement).
Currently I've added a tree view to the preset list combobox (so viewwing sub folders), and convertedn the methods that needed to.
At the moment one issue only is present: load the last selected preset when starting up the application. DOING


### Requirements

1. [JUCE v6.1.0](https://juce.com/get-juce/download) 
2. C++17 compiler
3. IDE of your choice (Visual Studio, Xcode, etc)
