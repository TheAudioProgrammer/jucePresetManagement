# Juce Preset Manager
This is a Fork of [this project](https://github.com/TheAudioProgrammer/jucePresetManagement).\
The aim of this fork is to provide a version of the JucePresetManagement original repo a "tree like" presets visualization which in my opinion could be a nice feature to have.


### Requirements

1. [JUCE v6.1.0](https://juce.com/get-juce/download) 
2. C++17 compiler
3. IDE of your choice (Visual Studio, Xcode, etc)
